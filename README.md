### - DataSet

I have couple of data from 22nd january 2020 to 6th March 2020 and will try to analysis the dataset. The data tells us the country, province, confirmed cases, death and the people recovering form the disease. The data was all over the place and therefore needed to aggregate all data in a single file ina readable format.

### - Visualization

I have used Tableau for my analysis. The first worksheet shows increasing number of cases per day over the world. As we play, we see that the rate of increase is huge in China as compared to the other country.

Moving further, I check if the number of death is at the same rate as number of confirmed cases. After visualizing, it came that mortality rate is very low in comparison to the confirmed cases daily. Also, we can see that the red dots are all over the europe, japan, South korean and usa but the amount of cases there is very less as compared to the China and Italy and therefore the size is small.

Since, China was on top of the death count and to further see which provinces of China is badly affected by Corona Virus, I played with the province dataset. Here, you can see that major outbreak happened in the region of Hubei which makes sense as Wuhan is the place from where virus originated and it is the Capital of Hubei.

I am trying to keep this updated so that I can analyse the updates and pattern. If you would like to check my work on this, you can go to my Tableau.
